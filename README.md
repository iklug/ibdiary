# IBDiary

A web application designed for people who have inflammatory bowel disease.

## Description

I was inspired to create IBDiary after working in a GI lab for many years. I worked with a physician that would go to great lengths to understand the daily stressors of a patient's life as they could potentially result in worse symptoms and clinical outcomes.

IBDiary would appear to be a calendar at first glance. At its core it is a calendar that I built in React but it has a number of other little features.

The difference between IBDiary and your standard calendar is a focus on documenting stress through the Reflection tab when creating events.

In this the user can document a daily reflection on how the day has gone, what stressors they may be facing, what emotions they are feeling and a number from 0 - 4 describing their overall stress level.

They can then create a classic calendar 'event' which may include scheduled appointments and other events, but also the food they are eating, the medication they are taking and the symptoms they may be experiencing.

My goal is for IBDiary to be a comprehensive breakdown of everything patients with IBD are facing so they can more effectively understand their IBD as well as help describe how their course has been in between visits to their gastroenterologist.
